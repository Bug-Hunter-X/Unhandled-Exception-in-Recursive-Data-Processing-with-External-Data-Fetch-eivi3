This repository contains a PHP example showcasing a common but subtle error in data processing. The `processData` function recursively processes nested arrays, fetching external data based on string prefixes.  The `fetchData` function, simulating external data access, lacks proper error handling. This can cause the program to unexpectedly fail if an invalid key is encountered during data retrieval.  The solution demonstrates how to add error handling and improve data validation.
